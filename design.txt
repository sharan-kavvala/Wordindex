Fields :

-MapString, SetInteger index stores the word-to-page mapping
-SetString excludeWords stores the excluded words
Methods
-void readFiles() reads the input files and stores the information in appropriate data structures
-void writeToFile() writes the contents of the index to a file named index.txt
-static void main(String[] args) creates an instance of the WordIndex class, calls the readFiles()
 and writeToFile() methods, and handles any exceptions that may occur during their execution

This design separates the data storage (index and excludeWords fields) and the data processing
logic (readFiles() and writeToFile() methods) into separate classes, making the code more organized 
and easier to maintain. The main method serves as the entry point for the program and is responsible
for creating an instance of the WordIndex class, calling the appropriate methods, and handling any 
exceptions that may occur.
